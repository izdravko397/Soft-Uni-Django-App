i want to create a library system with python django, we will be working with docker postgresql, i want 2 types of users, 1 to be a customer, the customer will be able to get books, and until the customer returns the book, it is shown as not available in the library. second account is library managment account, this type of user will be able to change the library's name(which will also be the librarys user name) and inventory(make,edit and delete books), the feed will be just a list with all the posts(books in the library) and the feed is going to have a search bar for the books
